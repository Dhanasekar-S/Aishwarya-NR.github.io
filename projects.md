<h3>Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed text</h3>
Sentiment Analysis seeks to identify the opinions and viewpoints communicated in a given

piece of data which is generally in the form of text. In the recent years, there have been

many attempts to classify texts from various sources based on their polarity. However, a

major challenge in analyzing textual data is Code-Mixing. Especially, in a multilingual

country like India where about 22 official languages exist, Code-Mixing is very prominent.

For example, many native languages are Code-Mixed in English script. In this project,

we attempt provide a sentiment analysis of Telugu, Tamil and Hindi social media textual

content obtained from various kind of social media sources like Twitter, Facebook e.t.c.

The model will classify a given text into positive, negative and neutral.
