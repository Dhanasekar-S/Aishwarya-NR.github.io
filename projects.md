<h3>Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed text _(2016-Present)_</h3>
Sentiment Analysis seeks to identify the opinions and viewpoints communicated in a given piece of data which is generally in the form of text. In the recent years, there have been many attempts to classify texts from various sources based on their polarity. However, a major challenge in analyzing textual data is Code-Mixing. Especially, in a multilingual country like India where about 22 official languages exist, Code-Mixing is very prominent. For example, many native languages are Code-Mixed in English script. In this project, my team attempts to provide a sentiment analysis of Telugu, Tamil and Hindi social media textual content obtained from various kind of social media sources like Twitter, Facebook e.t.c. The model will classify a given text into positive, negative and neutral.

<h3>Personality Detection from Social Network Profiles (2016-Present)</h3>
According to statistics Facebook is the 2nd most popular and Twitter is the 10th most popular website now! Probably the meaning space of social-status and Facebook/Twitter status is coming closer day by day. There could be a perpetual debate on whether digital representations of us on Facebook/Twitter can capture much about human social relations, but the increasing popularity of these sites and data made urgency to develop technology to manage this information more intelligently than ever. With that necessity in mind the goal of my present research is to assess personality(Openness (O),Conscientiousness (C),Extraversion (E), Agreeableness (A), Neuroticism (N)called Big Five Model)of any user from his/her Facebook/Twitter interactions.

<h3>Shallow Parsing of Code-Mixed text (2016-Present)</h3>
In this project, me along with my team attempt to develop a Shallow parser for Code-Mixed social media text. Dependency parsing is the linguistic technique to identify dependent relations between textual components in a given natural language sentence. Parsing is a well studied paradigm for monolingual formal text whereas linguistic research on code-mixing multi-lingual text is new research strand altogether. Our current endeavor includes English-Hindi and English-Telugu parser development.

<h3>Values/Personality Community World Map (2016-Present) </h3>

To understand how someoneâ€™s personality and intrinsic values change with geolocation and city we intend to perform several experiments, the final outcome of which will be a map to represent geo-specific values.In order to create the World map, we intend to collect data from 40 most popular cities around the world. We will also be collecting the network structure of atleast 2000 users from each city and determine the Values and Personality and checking community Variations all over the world. This values/ethics map would provide an overview of the kind of values & Personalities possessed by people from different regions and community structure.
