<h3>Semantic Interpretation of Social Network Communities | (2016-Present)</h3>
In network science, a community is considered to be a group
of nodes densely connected internally and sparsely connected
externally. However, the semantic interpretation of a community
is hardly studied. In this project, my team attempts to understand
whether individuals in a community possess similar Personalities,
Values and Ethical background. Finally, we show that
Personality and Values models could be used as features to
discover more accurate community structure compared to the
one obtained from only network information.

<h3>Figurative Language Analysis | (2016-Present)</h3>
Figurative language is language that uses words or expressions with a meaning that is different from the literal interpretation. Figurative language is used with a  meaning  that  is  different  from  the  basic  meaning  and  thatexpresses an idea in an interesting way by using language thatusually describes something else. Therefore, one of the greatest challenges  in  computational  linguistics  is  figurative  languageprocessing,  since  the  words  or  expressions  used  possess  ameaning that is different from the literal interpretation. In my summer internship at NTU Singapore, I worked on analysis of various elements of figurative language. My team also developed an automatic satire detection system, we published a research paper on the works carried out in ICDM-Sentire-2016

<h3>Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed text | (2016-Present)</h3>
Sentiment Analysis seeks to identify the opinions and viewpoints communicated in a given piece of data which is generally in the form of text. In the recent years, there have been many attempts to classify texts from various sources based on their polarity. However, a major challenge in analyzing textual data is Code-Mixing. Especially, in a multilingual country like India where about 22 official languages exist, Code-Mixing is very prominent. For example, many native languages are Code-Mixed in English script. In this project, my team attempts to provide a sentiment analysis of Telugu, Tamil and Hindi social media textual content obtained from various kind of social media sources like Twitter, Facebook e.t.c. The model will classify a given text into positive, negative and neutral.

<h3>Personality Detection from Social Network Profiles | (2016-Present)</h3>
According to statistics Facebook is the 2nd most popular and Twitter is the 10th most popular website now! Probably the meaning space of social-status and Facebook/Twitter status is coming closer day by day. There could be a perpetual debate on whether digital representations of us on Facebook/Twitter can capture much about human social relations, but the increasing popularity of these sites and data made urgency to develop technology to manage this information more intelligently than ever. With that necessity in mind the goal of my present research is to assess personality(Openness (O),Conscientiousness (C),Extraversion (E), Agreeableness (A), Neuroticism (N)called Big Five Model)of any user from his/her Facebook/Twitter interactions.

<h3>Shallow Parsing of Code-Mixed text | (2016-Present)</h3>
In this project, me along with my team attempt to develop a Shallow parser for Code-Mixed social media text. Dependency parsing is the linguistic technique to identify dependent relations between textual components in a given natural language sentence. Parsing is a well studied paradigm for monolingual formal text whereas linguistic research on code-mixing multi-lingual text is new research strand altogether. Our current endeavor includes English-Hindi and English-Telugu parser development.

<h3>Values/Personality Community World Map | (2016-Present) </h3>
To understand how someoneâ€™s personality and intrinsic values change with geolocation and city we intend to perform several experiments, the final outcome of which will be a map to represent geo-specific values.In order to create the World map, we intend to collect data from 40 most popular cities around the world. We will also be collecting the network structure of atleast 2000 users from each city and determine the Values and Personality and checking community Variations all over the world. This values/ethics map would provide an overview of the kind of values & Personalities possessed by people from different regions and community structure.

<h3>Quad Control Robotic Arm for Assistance of Physically Challenged(Android-Based) | (2015)</h3>
Developed a prototype Robotic Arm for assisting aged and Physically Challenged people. The Arm uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as communication networks and works on four control mechanisms i.e., Remote, Smart Phone Tilt, Voice and Hand gesture recognition. User Interface is provided by self developed Android Application
